The curried function has two unusual capabilities. First, its\r\n     * arguments needn't be provided one at a time. If `g` is `R.curryN(3, f)`, the\r\n     * following are equivalent:\r\n     *\r\n     *   - `g(1)(2)(3)`\r\n     *   - `g(1)(2, 3)`\r\n     *   - `g(1, 2)(3)`\r\n     *   - `g(1, 2, 3)`\r\n     *\r\n     * Secondly, the special placeholder value `R.__` may be used to specify\r\n     * \"gaps\", allowing partial application of any combination of arguments,\r\n     * regardless of their positions. If `g` is as above and `_` is `R.__`, the\r\n     * following are equivalent:\r\n     *\r\n     *   - `g(1, 2, 3)`\r\n     *   - `g(_, 2, 3)(1)`\r\n     *   - `g(_, _, 3)(1)(2)`\r\n     *   - `g(_, _, 3)(1, 2)`\r\n     *   - `g(_, 2)(1)(3)`\r\n     *   - `g(_, 2)(1, 3)`\r\n     *   - `g(_, 2)(_, 3)(1)`\r\n     *\r\n     * @func\r\n     * @memberOf R\r\n     * @since v0.5.0\r\n     * @category Function\r\n     * @sig Number -> (* -> a) -> (* -> a)\r\n     * @param {Number} length The arity for the returned function.\r\n     * @param {Function} fn The function to curry.\r\n     * @return {Function} A new, curried function.\r\n     * @see R.curry\r\n     * @example\r\n     *\r\n     *      var sumArgs = (...args) => R.sum(args);\r\n     *\r\n     *      var curriedAddFourNumbers = R.curryN(4, sumArgs);\r\n     *      var f = curriedAddFourNumbers(1, 2);\r\n     *      var g = f(3);\r\n     *      g(4); //=> 10\r\n     */\r\n    var curryN = _curry2(function curryN(length, fn) {\r\n        if (length === 1) {\r\n            return _curry1(fn);\r\n        }\r\n        return _arity(length, _curryN(length, [], fn));\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n     * Decrements its argument.\r\n     *\r\n     * @func\r\n     * @memberOf R\r\n     * @since v0.9.0\r\n     * @category Math\r\n     * @sig Number -> Number\r\n     * @param {Number} n\r\n     * @return {Number}\r\n     * @see R.inc\r\n     * @example\r\n     *\r\n     *      R.dec(42); //=> 41\r\n     */\r\n    var dec = add(-1);\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n     * Returns the second argument if it is not `null`, `undefined` or `NaN`\r\n     * otherwise the first argument is returned.\r\n     *\r\n     * @func\r\n     * @memberOf R\r\n     * @since v0.10.0\r\n     * @category Logic\r\n     * @sig a -> b -> a | b\r\n     * @param {a} val The default value.\r\n     * @param {b} val The value to return if it is not null or undefined\r\n     * @return {*} The the second value or the default value\r\n     * @example\r\n     *\r\n     *      var defaultTo42 = R.defaultTo(42);\r\n     *\r\n     *      defaultTo42(null);  //=> 42\r\n     *      defaultTo42(undefined);  //=> 42\r\n     *      defaultTo42('Ramda');  //=> 'Ramda'\r\n     *      defaultTo42(parseInt('string')); //=> 42\r\n     */\r\n    var defaultTo = _curry2(function defaultTo(d, v) {\r\n        return v == null || v !== v ? d : v;\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n     * Finds the set (i.e. no duplicates) of all elements in the first list not\r\n     * contained in the second list.

The curried function\r\n     * has two unusual capabilities. First, its arguments needn't be provided one\r\n     * at a time. If `f` is a ternary function and `g` is `R.curry(f)`, the\r\n     * following are equivalent:\r\n     *\r\n     *   - `g(1)(2)(3)`\r\n     *   - `g(1)(2, 3)`\r\n     *   - `g(1, 2)(3)`\r\n     *   - `g(1, 2, 3)`\r\n     *\r\n     * Secondly, the special placeholder value `R.__` may be used to specify\r\n     * \"gaps\", allowing partial application of any combination of arguments,\r\n     * regardless of their positions. If `g` is as above and `_` is `R.__`, the\r\n     * following are equivalent:\r\n     *\r\n     *   - `g(1, 2, 3)`\r\n     *   - `g(_, 2, 3)(1)`\r\n     *   - `g(_, _, 3)(1)(2)`\r\n     *   - `g(_, _, 3)(1, 2)`\r\n     *   - `g(_, 2)(1)(3)`\r\n     *   - `g(_, 2)(1, 3)`\r\n     *   - `g(_, 2)(_, 3)(1)`\r\n     *\r\n     * @func\r\n     * @memberOf R\r\n     * @since v0.1.0\r\n     * @category Function\r\n     * @sig (* -> a) -> (* -> a)\r\n     * @param {Function} fn The function to curry.\r\n     * @return {Function} A new, curried function.\r\n     * @see R.curryN\r\n     * @example\r\n     *\r\n     *      var addFourNumbers = (a, b, c, d) => a + b + c + d;\r\n     *\r\n     *      var curriedAddFourNumbers = R.curry(addFourNumbers);\r\n     *      var f = curriedAddFourNumbers(1, 2);\r\n     *      var g = f(3);\r\n     *      g(4); //=> 10\r\n     */\r\n    var curry = _curry1(function curry(fn) {\r\n        return curryN(fn.length, fn);\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n     * Returns all but the first `n` elements of the given list, string, or\r\n     * transducer/transformer (or object with a `drop` method).\r\n     *\r\n     * Dispatches to the `drop` method of the second argument, if present.\r\n     *\r\n     * @func\r\n     * @memberOf R\r\n     * @since v0.1.0\r\n     * @category List\r\n     * @sig Number -> [a] -> [a]\r\n     * @sig Number -> String -> String\r\n     * @param {Number} n\r\n     * @param {*} list\r\n     * @return {*}\r\n     * @see R.take, R.transduce\r\n     * @example\r\n     *\r\n     *      R.drop(1, ['foo', 'bar', 'baz']); //=> ['bar', 'baz']\r\n     *      R.drop(2, ['foo', 'bar', 'baz']); //=> ['baz']\r\n     *      R.drop(3, ['foo', 'bar', 'baz']); //=> []\r\n     *      R.drop(4, ['foo', 'bar', 'baz']); //=> []\r\n     *      R.drop(3, 'ramda');               //=> 'da'\r\n     */\r\n    var drop = _curry2(_dispatchable('drop', _xdrop, function drop(n, xs) {\r\n        return slice(Math.max(0, n), Infinity, xs);\r\n    }));\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n     * Returns a list containing all but the last `n` elements of the given `list`.\r\n     *\r\n     * @func\r\n     * @memberOf R\r\n     * @since v0.16.0\r\n     * @category List\r\n     * @sig Number -> [a] -> [a]\r\n     * @sig Number -> String -> String\r\n     * @param {Number} n The number of elements of `xs` to skip.\r\n     * @param {Array} xs The collection to consider.\r\n     * @return {Array}\r\n     * @see R.takeLast\r\n     * @example\r\n     *\r\n     *      R.dropLast(1, ['foo', 'bar', 'baz']); //=> ['foo', 'bar']\r\n     *      R.dropLast(2, ['foo', 'bar', 'baz']); //=> ['foo']\r\n     *      R.dropLast(3, ['foo', 'bar', 'baz']); //=> []\r\n     *      R.dropLast(4, ['foo', 'bar', 'baz']); //=> []\r\n     *      R.dropLast(3, 'ramda');               //=> 'ra'\r\n     */\r\n    var dropLast = _curry2(_dispatchable('dropLast', _xdropLast, _dropLast));\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n     * Returns a new list containing all but last the`n` elements of a given list,\r\n     * passing each value from the right to the supplied predicate function,\r\n     * skipping elements while the predicate function returns `true`.
